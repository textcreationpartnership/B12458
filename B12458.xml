            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

No debt, though of millions, and to the cruelleſt creditor in all the world, is ſo dangerous, as deadly ſinne: no writte is ſo ineuitable as the curſes of Gods holie Law: and no arreſt is ſo vncomfortable and irkeſome, as the biting accuſations of the conſcience.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the continuall perill of death, of hell, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> doth maruellouſlie diſmay them, in ſo much that life it ſelfe, which all liuing creatures ardentlie deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and all the delights and priuiledges thereof, are of no eſtimation and value with them: the violent dread of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, draweth them often, to ſeeke their deſtruction with violence.</p>

Now to ſhunne theſe vicious extreames on both ſides, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the laudable mediocritie betweene them, theſe rules may direct vs. Firſt, that all our anger be onely for ſinne, and ſo we ſhall beſt put in practiſe the Apoſtles precept, to be <hi>angry and</hi>

                  <hi>ſinne not.</hi> Then ſhall we not be teaſtie with them that be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, becauſe we are incenſed by them that are faultie: then ſhall we neuer like fumiſh <hi>Balaam</hi> fall out with beaſts, &amp; vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures, much leſſe be imbittered againſt things that are ſenſeleſſe. Secondly, that our anger be meaſurably propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the meaſure of the offence, greateſt indignation muſt be conceiued againſt the greateſt tranſgreſſions, though they bring not to vs ſo great annoyances: and ſmaller faults ſhould leſſe diſpleaſe vs, though in priuate reſpects they ſeeme to be more for our dammage: for euery part ought rather to be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly affected at Gods diſhonour, then his owne detriment. Thridly, that it be not ouerlong continued, and exceſſiue in time, but bounded within the limits of a day at the furtheſt: the Lord would not haue <hi>wrath</hi> protracted till night, <hi>nor the ſunne to goe downe vpon it.</hi> Fourthly, that the crimes of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars, benefactors, kinsfolke, and deareſt friends, doe make
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:23500:34"/> vs more angrie then theirs that are not ſo neerly vnited to vs: that we take to heart the ſinne of our child, more then of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and of a yoke-fellow, more then of a childe: and our owne, more then a yoke-fellow, childe, brother, or of anie, or all others.</p>
               <p>Fiftlie, that the ire and wrath againſt the ſinnes of our neighbours, drawe not our ſelues into anie ſinfull behauiour againſt God, as to be fierce &amp; violent in reuengement, to raile, to reuile, to vomite out blaſphemies, or imprecations, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that it hinder vs not from, but further vs to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all good ſeruices, eſpeciallie in the behalfe of the parties delinquent, as to admoniſh them, pray for them, and giue them direction for reformation of their tranſgreſſions. <hi>And it is his glorie,</hi> it winneth him honour and praiſe, and that worthilie, <hi>to paſſe by an offence,</hi> to winke at ſmaller infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to remit greater wrongs, yet not ſo, as to be ſilent at Gods diſhonour, with the perill of the ſoule of the ſinner, or at the grieuances which are offered to himſelfe from them: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the forbearance of reuenge, and not of iuſt reproofe, or of due correction, is commended.</p>

               <p>THe dangerous effects of ſluggiſhnes, are here ſet downe, and deſcribed, whereof ſome are ſinnes, and heedfullie to be ſhunned, and others are puniſhments thereof, and greatly to be feared.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, immoderate and exceſſiue ſleeping, whereby mens callings and labours are neglected, their time loſt, and their wits and ſences dulled: and this groweth partly from the abundance of humors, by which the head is oppreſſed, &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie from the want of cheerfulnes, whereby the heart ſhould be refreſhed: and therefore obſerue, that all ſluggards are lumpiſh, and like dead men, ſauing when they be about the practiſe or proiect of ſome thing vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>This drowſineſſe of theirs, and diſpoſition to ſleepe, they are charged with, and challenged for, in the ſixt Chapter: <hi>How long wilt thou ſleepe, ô ſluggard, when wilt thou ariſe out of</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is deceitfulneſſe, beeing inferred in the latter clauſe, as that which inſueth both vpon ſlothfulnes and ſleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. For they that loſe their time, can neither get wealth well, nor keepe that which others haue formerly gathered by their trauell. Then muſt they needs fall into indigencie and want, and beeing not able to ſuſtaine the violence thereof, (for none are ſo impatient of pouertie, as thoſe who retchleſlie throwe themſelues into it,) they will liue by their wittes, and ſhift for themſelues, by falſhood and indirect courſes.</p>
               <p>The third, which is the puniſhment of all the former, is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and miſerable neceſſitie, which their fraude and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes doth double vpon them, and not preuent, or diminiſh. Or if it fall out that ſome by wrongfull dealing are holpen in their ſtate for a time, yet it turneth to their greater hurt, and deeper decay in time following: or if they thriue euen to their liues end, by their vniuſt and fraudulent practiſes, yet they ſhall rue it in the worldes ende, for the <hi>miſeries</hi> and plagues that will

               <p>The ſenſe therefore of the ſentence is this: Slothfulnes cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth<note place="margin">Iam. 5. 1.</note> men to be ſleepie and deceitfull, and hee that is deceitfull, ſleepie, or ſlothful, <hi>ſhall be affamiſhed.</hi>

               <p>¶ Slothfulnes is a vice verie hurtfull both to bodie, ſoule, and <label type="milestone">

Deceitfulnes is pernicious to the ſoule, and for conſcience ſake to be abhorred: and affamiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the deſolation of the ſtate, tending towardes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of life, and therefore is with due circumſpection and prouidencie to be preuented.

               <p>What thing is ſo dreadfull, grimme, and horrible, to all worldlie men, as penurie and neede?

               <p>Thus ſtandeth the oppoſition: Hee that keepeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and regardeth his wayes ſhall liue: but hee that breaketh the commandement, and deſpiſeth his wayes, ſhall die.</p>

               <p>Secondly, godly men are induſtrious and diligent in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> callings, and ſo their labours are bleſſed vnto them; and their prudent frugalitie and thriftines make a way for the increaſe of their ſubſtance and poſſeſſions.

               <p>The teſtimonie of the Prophet, being in ſubſtance Gods<note place="margin">Pſ. 119 165.</note> promiſe, is of large extent, ſaying, <hi>they that thy lawe ſhall haue great proſperitie, and they ſhall haue none hurt.</hi> And the ſpeech of <hi>Eliphas</hi> to <hi>Iob,</hi> is of no ſmall force, when he ſaith, <hi>He ſhall deliuer</hi>

               <p>Confutation of that pernitious errour, which too many, both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> men and women illude themſelues with, that youth yeeldeth a priuiledge to them that are young, to bee impious, proude, ryo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and wanton with impunity. It is thought that they be fooliſh, and mopiſh, and haue degenerated from their age, which will giue themſelues to the ſeruice of any but of ſinne and luſt, till they be paſt that age. Why then did not the youthfull Sodomites plead their priuiledge, and preſerue themſelues from deſtruction when the reſt periſhed?

And let them alſo be admoniſhed, whoſe vlcers of vicious behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our are to be tented with the rodde of correction, that they take not the outward application of ſtripes, or other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments to be ſufficient for their curing. The humours that doe feede their ſores, doe iſſue from their ſoules, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer their faults be, and therefore they muſt haue Godly ſorrow, and humiliation applyed inwardly vnto them, or elſe all the ſtrokes that light vpon their bodies, will doe more hurt to conuince them of obſtinacy, then worke any good for their amendment. And ſo after man hath done with chaſtiſements, they prouoke God to beginne with plagues, and curſes: and then their bodily paine which they made not better vſe of, will be a foregoer of their ſpirituall torment, from vvhich they ſhall neuer bee deliuered. Happy therefore is he that ſtriketh his hart with Godly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall griefe or feare, when God or Man doth ſmite his fleſh, with externall afflictions or ſcourges: for that ſhort and momentary ſmart and mourning is made a meanes of his reuocation, and ſo by conſequent of his perpetuall comfort and bleſſedneſſe.</p>
